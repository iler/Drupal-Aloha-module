INSTALL

Download the aloha editor from http://www.aloha-editor.org/ 

Then extact into the path 'sites/all/libraries/aloha'.

Now the module will use the libary.

Go any node and click or highlight the body text and edit from there.

It saves when you click away from the text as well as change the formating.

This is a forked copy of original project from drupal.org because the maintainers are inactive at the moment.
